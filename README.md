## What is Catalan's Constant?

Catalan's constant is a mathematical constant denoted by **G**, approximately equal to 0.915965594177219015. It appears in various combinatorial problems and is defined by the infinite series:

\[ G = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)^2} \]

This series converges slowly but provides a precise way to compute the constant.

### Applications in Mathematics

1. **Combinatorics**: Catalan's constant arises in the enumeration of certain combinatorial structures.
2. **Number Theory**: It is linked to the properties of various number sequences.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: The constant appears in calculations involving polygamma and trigamma functions.
